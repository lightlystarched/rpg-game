A simple RPG I'm making in Godot in order to learn GDScript and play around with game development practices.

Initial code is from the YouTube tutorial by DevWorm: [How to Create an RPG in Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBoXqW4RykE&list=PL3cGrGHvkwn0zoGLoGorwvGj6dHCjLaGd).

Assets are from Game Endeavor: [Mystic Woods asset pack](https://game-endeavor.itch.io/mystic-woods)

Aside from that, the rest of the code and work added is by me.
